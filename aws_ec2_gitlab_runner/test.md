# Using EC2 as Gitlab Runner? But why?
### If you're familiar with that situation when...
- your pipeline didn't seem to want to start
- moved very slowly/need more power
- you consumed already the free tier of minutes...

### Then you might want to try using AWS resources for your Gitlab jobs.

# Steps: 

<details><summary> 1) Create an EC2  </summary>

 ### Prerequisites:
 - active AWS account preferably in the free tier period, as you have free access to EC2 t2 micro instance type
 
 ### Actions:
 - From the EC2 page, click on 'Launch instance' (region is not important)

<details><summary> 2) Install GITLAB runner  </summary>
Now that we have access to the instance(terminal), it's time to configure it.
 
### Actions:
 
 - update the machine
 
`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`
 
 - check if git is available:
 
 `git --version`  
 
 - if not available use the following command to install it:
 
 `sudo apt install git`
 
 - install docker
 
 `sudo apt install docker.io`
 
 - add our user to the docker group
 
 `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
 
 - make sure docker will start automatically with the instance
 
 'sudo systemctl enable docker'
 
 - reboot our instance (wait 2 3 minutes, then reconnect from EC2 window)
 
 'sudo reboot'
  
 - right after reconnecting, check id docker is already running
 
 `systemctl status docker`
 
 - check if docker if working properly
 
 `docker run hello-world`
