# Using EC2 as Gitlab Runner? But why?
### If you're familiar with that situation when...
- your pipeline didn't seem to want to start
- moved very slowly/need more power
- you consumed already the free tier of minutes...

### Then you might want to try using AWS resources for your Gitlab jobs.

# Steps: 

<details><summary> 1) Create an EC2  </summary>

 ### Prerequisites:
 - active AWS account preferably in the free tier period, as you have free access to EC2 t2 micro instance type
 
 ### Actions:
 1)  From the EC2 page, click on 'Launch instance' (region is not important)
